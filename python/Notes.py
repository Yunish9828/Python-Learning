# data : any piece of information
# Two types of data:

# Numerical : Discrete(countable), Continuous(Measurable)
# Categorial : Nominal(not ordered), ordinal(Ordered)

# Measures of Central Tendency

# mean, median, mode
# statistics is the branch of science that deals with the collection, analysis and presenting of the data.

# Two types of stats:

# descriptives stat
# inferential stat

# Measures of Central Tendency

# Mean(Average value): Number that generalizes the data.
# Median(Mid-value): Number that is in the middle of the data when kept in ascending or descending order.
# Mode(): The most repeated freqeuncey is mode. Used in Categorial data.


# Outliers: data that is different from the other.

# Measures of central tendency
# Dispersion: 
# Variance: Spreadness of the data

# Standard deviation is used instead of mean because the spreadness or the difference
#  in the data is more in mean than that of standard deviation.

# Variable: Something that can be changed or vary.

# Independent
# Dependent


# y = mx + c    
# slope: Rate of change of x in compared to y
# x 1 le badhdha y kati le badhxa
# y = mx + c works only in the straight line because slope is same in every point of the straight line.
# Extracting knowledge from the given data set is data science.
# Data should be stored at first.
# Library is collection of similar codes.

# Python is productive not fast
# Numpy is written in python but run in C
# List is heterogenous and array is homogeneous
# Array of numpy is known as ndarray
# Python lists are excellent, general-purpose containers. They can be “heterogeneous”,
#  meaning that they can contain elements of a variety of types, and they are quite fast
#  when used to perform individual operations on a handful of elements.

# Why numpy is used: Depending on the characteristics of the data and the types of operations 
# that need to be performed, other containers may be more appropriate; by exploiting these 
# characteristics, we can improve speed, reduce memory consumption, and offer a high-level 
# syntax for performing a variety of common processing tasks. NumPy shines when there are 
# large quantities of “homogeneous” (same-type) data to be processed on the CPU.4

# Homogenous is really efficient.

# shape = number of rows and columns
# ndim = number of dimensions 
# size = number of elements in the array.
# dtype = data type of the elements.
